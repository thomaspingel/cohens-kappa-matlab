This is a simple implementation of Cohen's Kappa statistic, which measures agreement for two judges for values on a nominal scale. See the Wikipedia entry for a quick overview, or you can get the original article from Sage Publications. Kappa has been used extensively in psychology, and has been more recently applied to land cover / land use changes and to assessments of accuracy for classification algorithms in Remote Sensing (Congalton, 1991; Jensen, 2005).
